The program used to analyze LC-MS/MS derived Proteomics data in <https://doi.org/10.1101/629048> has been divided into 3 categories:
1. Downstream Processing.R
2. GO.R
3. KEGG.R

***Visualizations from source:*** 
*RAW264.7 MÏ† were infected with Mtb and Hk-Mtb at moi 10 or left uninfected. At 24 h p.i., exosomes were isolated from the culture supernatant for LC-MS/MS. (A) Heat map of differentially expressed proteins of exosomes in three samples. (B) Volcano plots of differentially expressed proteins. Significantly up-regulated and down-regulated proteins with log2 fold change more than two are shown as orange dots. (C) Enriched KEGG signaling pathways, proteins upregulated or downregulated in different comparison groups: (heat killed) Hk-Mtb versus live Mtb, Hk-Mtb versus UI (uninfected) and live Mtb versus UI (uninfected).*
